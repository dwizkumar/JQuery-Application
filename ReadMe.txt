 In the JQuery project I have pulled the dynamic data using ajax call. I have used some of the animation such as bouncing the arrow, Slide in content in about section while loading, and on hover ease-in and ease-out.
 
 I have also given menu option by which a user can navigate to all the important section just by a click.
 
 I have also given search box but I have not implmented any functionality to it.
 
 Wrote functionality for smooth scrolling when a menu bar is clicked.
 
 Used some of JQuery plugin:
 - Magnific-Popup plugin for popup
 - JConfirm plugin for popup
 - DataTable plugin for pagination (to show employment and coop table)
 - Used plugin for map

 Apart from all these used logo and images from fontawesome.

 For student resource section I used some hardcoded data. Since data was unavailable in API document.
 
 Consumed all API's documented in API document.
